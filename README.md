## Assessing Security Culture
____________
## Step 1: Measure and Set Goals
________

### 1. Using outside research, indicate the potential security risks of allowing employees to access work information on their personal devices. Identify at least three potential attacks that can be carried out.


+ #### Malicious code. Anyone can have malicious code downloaded on their phone from an outside source. If they clicked on a link that was malvertising then it can bring a trojan through the system. Communication Intercepts which is when a device aka a phone is connected to a network that the phone signal can be taken and decrypted and then seen what's going on. I think finally I would say physical access to a phone . If someone was able to gain physical access then they might have passwords to certain companies' data. Which is a big red flag. 
	

### 2. Based on the previous scenario, what is the preferred employee behavior? (For example, if employees were downloading suspicious email attachments, the preferred behavior would be that employees only download attachments from trusted sources.)


+ #### Malicious code. I would say that the only way to prevent this is to put controls in place that allow users only a certain access to certain known sites. I would also say address the employees to let them know that they shouldn't click on any links that look suspicious. If they feel it is to come to the IT department we can take care of that. Communication intercepts is something that is hard to prevent because most people like having their phones readily accessible. However, you can put in signal blockers that prevent the signal or radio waves from leaving the building or facility . You can make them a private guest network that is off to the side of the main network to prevent issues of having them not allowed access to the internet. This is purely based on the company's intended business. Physical Access is the last one. I say the best thing to prevent this is don't lose your phone especially work phones. I would hold quarterly meetings about this and state and show how bad this could be. I also would be happy to help anyone who had left their phones and had recently got it back to make sure nothing has been put onto the device and is safe to be on company network again. 
	

### 3. What methods would you use to measure how often employees are currently not behaving according to the preferred behavior? (For example, conduct a survey to see how often people download email attachments from unknown senders.)


+ #### Malicious code I would be sending a lot of phishing emails out to see if people clicked on links. I would also send out targeted ads based on personal preference.I would gather the data to see how many of my phishing schemes worked. Communication Intercepts. I sorta touched upon this with signal blockers and allowing employees their own network. However, depending on the nature of the company would determine how I went about this. Physical Access best way to do this is quarterly meetings to address the importance of not leaving your phone unintended somewhere. I would also show slides on how easily they can be tampered with. 
	

### 4. What is the goal that you would like the organization to reach regarding this behavior? (For example, to have less than 5% of employees downloading suspicious email attachments.)


+ #### Malicious code. I would like this below or around 7%. If higher i would address what we are doing to try and see if we can do something to lower that number more. If it's too high then obviously we are doing something wrong all together. Communication Intercepts ideally would like to keep at 0% but would be acceptable to have 10% intercepted . Physical access should be below 5%. People shouldn't be leaving work devices around to be accessed by and unknown party 
	



## Step 2: Involve the Right People
______
### 5. List at least five employees or departments that should be involved. For each person or department, describe in 2–3 sentences what their role and responsibilities will be.

+ #### First person should be involved is HR to ensure all policies regarding employee handing and legal are properly gone about. They would be proofing all our stuff to insure there is no discrimination or otherwise.Next would be the CEO to let them know about what my coming plan is to help make the company safer. I would want them to back my plan in case it does involve financial burden on the company. Next I would go to the CTO Make sure they were okay with these changes and see if he wanted to add anything to insure we can make these changes quick and allow for the flow to continue at work. Then I would want my IT department and my HR department to come up with slides and implement said things to make our security better. Lastly would be the engineering or outsourcing needed to put certain measures in place such as the signal blockers.  
	



## Step 3: Training Plan
_______

### 6. How frequently will you run training? What format will it take (e.g., in-person, online, a combination of both)?


+ #### I would run my training quarterly with it being a combination of in-person and online training. I find the best way for people to learn is to do it repeatedly. I would want online to be done more on a monthly thing to keep people engaged on what's going on pertaining to their jobs.  
	

### 7. What topics will you cover in your training, and why? (This should be the bulk of the deliverable.)


+ #### Would cover phishing exercises and try and make that as fun as possible. I want people to understand the importance of not clicking on links that's not known. I would demonstrate how bad a phishing email or link could be by hooking one of the people in the meeting. Show them how just a little bit of social engineering can go along ways. I would remind everyone that bringing phones into the workplace can pose a lot of risk. One of those is that the phone's signal could be intercepted. I would let everyone know that we will be implementing signal blockers or not allowing people to connect to the main company internet network. Instead they will have a less accessible network they can use. I would explain why this is better than having everyone having access to our network. Finally I would discuss issues of leaving your phone somewhere and how bad this could be for the company. I would make a play out of it with a few people from the IT department that want to play along and show how easy it is to break through phone passwords and gain access to sensitive data. I would finally end my quarterly meeting with any questions and probably mention that we have some giveaways to those who alert us of issues with phishing or physically leaving their phones behind somewhere.
	

### 8. After you’ve run your training, how will you measure its effectiveness? 


+ #### I would perform target social engineering attacks again on people who failed first time around and see how many of those I didn't get through. If i hook or capture too many people ideally my training was ineffective. I would try and leave phone place or attempt to take phones from people who leave those phones in public places, and go through them and instruct those people how bad it is to lose them, I finally would run a survey on the company to see how they like the other network and less interaction with using the phones as primary work devices and instead use company devices such as computer or work phones provided by the company.
